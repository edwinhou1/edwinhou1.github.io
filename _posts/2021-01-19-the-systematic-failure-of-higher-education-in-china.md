Author: Jenny
Synopsis:
Chase Carter never thought that the first person to come after his death would be Julian Jian.  
Julian was a few years older than Chase. Because their families were old acquaintances, they were quite familiar with each other.  
Julian was competent at managing the company. At a young age, he had become independent from the Jian family, established his own company, and his business was booming. This success not only elevated Julian but also raised the entire Jian family.  
Though Julian seemed impressive, Chase's impression of him wasn't quite so positive.  
Yes, Julian was handsome. Even with his often cold demeanor, he was undeniably good-looking.  
The first time Chase met Julian, he was quite taken aback by his appearance. So, he admitted that Julian was a handsome guy.  
Chase also admitted that had Julian's disposition appealed to him, he might have been rather clingy.  
Chapter 3: Julian Jian's Sincere Emotions  
Chase Carter never thought that the first person to come after his death would be Julian Jian.  
Julian was a few years older than Chase. Because their families were old acquaintances, they were quite familiar with each other.  
Julian was competent at managing the company. At a young age, he had become independent from the Jian family, established his own company, and his business was booming. This success not only elevated Julian but also raised the entire Jian family.  
Though Julian seemed impressive, Chase's impression of him wasn't quite so positive.  
Yes, Julian was handsome. Even with his often cold demeanor, he was undeniably good-looking.  
The first time Chase met Julian, he was quite taken aback by his appearance. So, he admitted that Julian was a handsome guy.  
Chase also admitted that had Julian's disposition appealed to him, he might have been rather clingy.  
But Julian tended to meddle a lot in Chase's life. Since the two families were close, Julian and Chase often met, and as an outstanding contemporary, Julian was prone to make comparisons.  
Chase was a rather carefree and spontaneous person, a bit more naive than most, who only wanted to enjoy life to the fullest without worrying about work or social obligations.  
Given that his parents had always pampered him, as the sole heir of the Carter family, living happily was all that mattered. The cutthroat world of business was unrelated to Chase.  
Hence, Chase detested being constrained, and Julian Jian was the person who liked to constrain him most.  
As the "child next door," when Chase was applying for college, Julian provided him with many suggestions.  
Taking Julian's advice, Chase applied to that college, only to later find out that the professor of his major knew Julian.  
Julian asked the professor to be strict with Chase, leading to Chase always being singled out in class and his assignments scrutinized rigorously.  
For a long time, the usually cheerful young master lived with a distressed and haggard expression.  
"Why did you tell Professor Li to be stricter with me!" Chase vented his frustrations towards Julian: "I've been living in fear of failing my exams, and I'm busy all the time!"  
"It's for your own good. Don't you feel your life is more fulfilled?"  
"Fulfilled? Sure, so fulfilled I don't even have time to drink with friends!"  
Later, when Chase encountered Scott Garrison and they were at their most intimate, Julian threw cold water on him.  
"I advise you not to get too close to Scott."  
"Why?" Chase was incredulous: "We get along very well."  
"His intentions are not pure."  
Chase immediately retorted: "What do you mean, not pure? He's been very nice to me. I think you're just being paranoid."  
In the end, when Chase and Scott became a couple, all his friends sent their blessings, except for Julian, who opposed the relationship.  
"I advise you to reconsider this relationship."  
This time, Chase ran out of patience: "What’s it to you, Julian? We're not that close, so why are you meddling in my life? Who I date is my business, not yours!"  
Julian fell silent, his gaze towards Chase dark and inscrutable. In his eyes, Chase was like a stubborn animal, charging headlong in the wrong direction.  
Eventually, Julian simply closed his eyes and said, "I'm sorry."  
Back then, Chase felt victorious, thinking he had finally escaped Julian's constraints. Looking back now, he realized what a huge joke that was.  
In reality, every piece of advice Julian gave him was spot-on.  
In college, thanks to the professor Julian recommended, though Chase struggled, he excelled in economics and management.  
When the Carter family started to decline and his father fell ill, it was Julian's advice that allowed Chase to barely support the company and his family.  
Julian had been right about Scott's intentions. Now that Chase saw the truth, he realized Julian's genuine concern.  
And now, the person who came to see him was still Julian.  
Chase sighed. Suddenly, he felt that everything he had done in the past twenty years was wrong, and he should have been better to Julian.  
Julian stood at the door, looking at the person covered with a white sheet on the bed. At first, he couldn't believe it, then gradually, his shock faded until his eyes turned inscrutable again.  
But he still stood at the doorway, not moving. Perhaps others might not understand his thoughts, but he didn't dare to enter.  
He feared seeing Chase's all too familiar face. Even though he knew the truth, the strong Julian could not bring himself to walk past indifferently.  
A secretary-like figure stood beside Julian, about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, carrying a briefcase and wearing black-rimmed glasses.  
"President..." Secretary Liu hesitated.  
Julian didn't speak. He closed his eyes and then walked towards the bed.  
Noticing Julian coming, Chase quickly made room for him. The two stood side by side, one real and one ethereal, one knowing and the other unable to see.  
"..." Julian stared at the white sheet covering Chase, then reached out and slowly lifted it.  
As soon as Chase's face was revealed, Julian let go of the sheet.  
Being intangible, Chase couldn't lift the sheet covering him. He was curious about his appearance - was it muddied, twisted in pain?  
He leaned in to look at himself.  
Lying on the bed, he looked peaceful, his face not contorted in anguish. If one ignored the mud on his face, he actually looked rather handsome.  
"My eyelashes are really long," even at a time like this, Chase couldn't resist commenting.  
Not too bad, not too dreadful— at least his face was intact.  
Comforting himself with this thought, Chase turned to see Julian's reaction but suddenly heard a soft sound.  
"—Drip."  
What was that noise? Chase wondered.  
Then, noticing the two spreading stains on the pristine sheet, Chase belatedly turned and saw Julian's trembling hand.  
Julian's face remained expressionless if one ignored his reddened eyes.  
Julian furrowed his brow, extended his hand, and gently wiped the mud from Chase's cheek.  
Following that, Chase watched as the tall man, holding his hand, slowly knelt down.  
"Breaking news on XX Road tonight, an accident resulted in one fatality and one injury. Details of the case are currently under investigation..."
