[Ice-cold CEO x Naive Heir]  
After perishing in a car accident, Ethan Chase transformed into a spirit. Seeing the world from a third-person perspective, he started to discern who was genuinely sincere and who was merely feigning.  
Previously, Ethan loathed and even feared to be near the CEO, Nathan Jennings. Yet, after his death, Nathan was the sole individual to pay his respects.  
And Scott Garrison, who pretended to be tender and kind, turned out to be a scoundrel who approached him solely to loot and run, leaving Ethan's family destitute and ruined!  
As Ethan watched Nathan avenge him and shed tears for him, apart from crying, there was nothing else he could do.  
"Nathan, I apologize, I'm so sorry... If there's another life, I swear I will—!"  
Reborn, Ethan decides to cherish life and reform himself!  
Nathan Jennings? Fall in love swiftly without wasting the second chance!  
"Ethan, how are you now? Still in pain?"  
"Ouch...it's painful!" Ethan greedily absorbed the sight of the man before him, overwhelmed with relief as one spared from disaster.  
"Where does it hurt? Come on, let's head to the hospital now."  
"Nathan, actually, there's no need for a hospital." Ethan's hand curled around Nathan Jennings's neck: "Just embrace me, and I'll cease to feel any pain."  
The scoundrel Scott Garrison? Set traps for him! Deceive him to his last penny!  
"Scott Garrison, so it's just everyone deserting you, your spouse and children gone, and your business bankrupt—is that too much for you to bear?"

Chapter 1: Dead, Utterly Dead  
It was pouring rain.  
Ethan Chase held an umbrella over his head as he walked along the road, one step deep, the next shallow.  
Even though he had just retrieved the lifesaving money from his father, he felt disoriented and forlorn.  
Suddenly a loud honking noise from behind startled him, and he turned his head instinctively, only to see the dazzling headlights and a car speeding straight towards him.  
The roaring of the engine and the sound of the tires splashing through puddles became unbearably distinct. Ethan's pupils contracted, and before a sound could escape his lips, he lost consciousness.  
When he awoke, he saw his own body lying on the ground.  
Was he... dead?  
Ethan looked down to see his hand extended in front of him, transparent and faintly glowing in the night. He felt light, almost floating, and a chill embraced him.  
Beside him, the car that had struck him wasn't the only one implicated; a black Maybach seemed to have been involved as well.  
From the car that hit him, a plain-looking young man in his twenties descended. He appeared exhausted and was clearly unable to see Ethan standing there. He walked up to Ethan's body, crouched down for a close examination, and then gave a nod.  
"Dead, utterly dead," he stated.  
Then, the young man pulled out his phone and made a call. Ethan approached him and listened in on the conversation.  
"...Yes, he's dead, no breathing... The money you promised for my sister, make sure she gets it... Don't worry, I'll admit it was my doing."  
The call ended, and the young man exhaled a sigh of relief, then dialed again: "Hello, is this the police? I hit someone on XX Street. Yes, it was me who did it."  
Ethan was sure he did not know this young man; he was utterly perplexed. Shortly after, the police arrived, quickly cordoned off the area, and began their inquiry.  
Amid the noisy scene, the police found Ethan's shattered cell phone on him: "The deceased is Ethan Chase, male, twenty-three years old..."  
Logically, after a person dies, the family should be called, right?  
Ethan watched as the police searched through his contact list and found his father's number. He sighed with a bitter smile.  
His father was seriously ill and bedridden; coming over in person, let alone answering the phone, was incredibly difficult.  
The call went unanswered, and the two police officers exchanged a glance of resignation. They dialed another number: "Hello, is this Mr. Garrison? Do you know Ethan Chase? We're at XX Street where an accident occurred, are you able to come over..."  
Ethan never imagined that the first person to arrive after his death would be the one he loved the most—Scott Garrison.  
The young man with kind eyes hurriedly stepped out of the car and then arrived at the scene. When he saw the body on the ground, he closed his eyes, his expression one of profound sorrow.  
"May I ask if you are Scott Garrison?"  
"Yes, I am Scott Garrison. Ethan's friend."  
Ethan, watching Scott Garrison who had rushed to the scene, felt the sting of tears coming. In his family's downfall, the only person who still remembered and cared for him was Scott.  
He watched Scott talking with the police, saw the evident sorrow and disorientation on Scott's face, and instinctively wanted to throw himself into Scott's embrace for comfort.  
But Ethan lunged forward only to pass right through him; he was now a spirit and could not touch Scott's physical form.  
Ethan stood there, staring at his own hand before looking back at Scott, uncertain whether he felt more grief or a poignant sense of appreciation.  
Scott, the person he had loved for so many years, had always been unwaveringly gentle with him.  
After the paramedics arrived and confirmed Ethan's death, issuing a death certificate, his body was temporarily placed in a nearby hospital, as no family member had appeared.  
One of the sympathetic officers patted Scott on the shoulder, "I'm sorry for your loss."  
Scott, with teary eyes, struggled to form a small smile in response to the officer’s comfort: "Thank you."  
After all procedures were completed, the police took the driver and his car away, and Scott also got into his car to leave.  
Ethan was confused; he could no longer return to his body and did not know where to go next.  
So, he, too, got into Scott's car. After such a shock and ordeal, he only wanted to stay close to Scott.  
Ethan had left Scott's home just half an hour earlier, and a few minutes later by car, Scott was already back at his house.  
Ethan followed Scott, watching him lock the car, climb the stairs, unlock the front door, and return to his bedroom, sitting on the bed without caring for his soaked clothes.  
Scott stared into space, his eyes still red. One could barely guess the depth of grief he had just shown.  
Ethan felt that Scott was mourning for him, which left him aching, and he reached out a hand trying to touch Scott's fingers. But in the next second, Scott moved his hand away and took out his phone to dial a number.  
Then Ethan heard a conversation that shattered him.  
"Hello, Vivian?" Scott spoke in a soft voice, the tone tender: "It's me, Scott."  
"Come over; Ethan is dead."  
"Yeah, he's finally dead—it’s been so long, I've waited for this day to rid us of that pest!"  
"Ha ha! I couldn't stand that disgusting guy; can you believe he said he loved me? How revolting. At least we've already taken all that we could from the Chase estate; he truly was of no further use."  
...What?  
Ethan could not come to grips with the situation—he looked at the man who had shown such tenderness over his body, now cruel, and the corners of his mouth twisted into a sinister smile.  
Scott hung up the phone and began pacing around the room.  
He paused in front of his bookcase, where the most conspicuous item was a frame with a photo of the two of them together.  
In the photo, Ethan looked younger than now, fair and slender, with delicate features but still handsome, his smile beaming at the camera.  
His hand was held tightly by Scott, the picture radiated a subtle warmth and intimacy. Scott’s demeanor hadn’t changed much, always that gentle mien that seemed so inviting.  
Scott opened the bookcase, retrieved the frame, ran his fingers over the photograph, over Ethan's smiling face, then casually curled into a smile.  
"...Thinking about it now, the feeling of disgust is still so vivid, huh."  
Ethan still felt a pang in his heart hearing such words from Scott's mouth, an uncontrollable urge to cry emerging.  
He simply could not understand how it all turned out this way.  
A knock on the door brought Scott back from his thoughts with a start: "Coming."  
He pulled the photograph from its frame without hesitation, tossed it into the waste bin, and only then went to answer the door.
