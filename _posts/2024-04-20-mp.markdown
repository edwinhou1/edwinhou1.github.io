Chapter 1: 
Dead, Dead for SureDownpour.Ethan Chase, under his umbrella, trudged along the street in heavy steps.Even with the money raised for his father's life-saving treatment, he was disoriented and distraught.Suddenly, a loud horn blared behind him, causing Ethan to startle and instinctively look back. What he saw were dazzling headlights and a car charging toward him.The roar of the engine and the sound of tires splashing water became startlingly clear. Ethan's pupils dilated, and before he could make a sound, consciousness fled him.Upon awakening, he saw his body lying on the ground.Was he... dead?Ethan looked down, stretching his hand in front of him - it was translucent, emitting a faint light in the dark. He felt his body light and somewhat cold.Looking aside, besides the car that hit him, there seemed another black Maybach involved in the accident.Ethan saw a disheveled youth in his twenties exit the assaulting vehicle. Clearly, the youth, looking weary, couldn’t see Ethan standing there; he walked straight to Ethan's body, bent down for a close look, then nodded."Dead, dead for sure."Then, the youth pulled out his phone and made a call, with Ethan hearing every word clearly."...Yes, he's dead, no breath... Make sure my sister gets the promised money... Don't worry, I'll admit to my actions."After hanging up, the young man sighed in relief and made another call: "Hello, 911? I’ve hit someone, here on xx road. Yes, it was me."Ethan was certain he didn't know this young man, feeling utterly baffled. As time went on, the police arrived, quickly sealing off the area to begin their investigation.The scene was chaotically noisy; the police found Ethan's broken-screen phone on him: "The deceased is Ethan Chase, male, twenty-three years old..."Normally, the family would be summoned for such occurrences, right?Watching the police scroll through his contacts to find his father's number, Ethan sighed sadly.His father, gravely ill, would find it difficult even to answer a call, let alone come here.The call didn’t go through, the two officers exchanged a look of helplessness, then dialed another number: "Hello, is this Mr. Garrison? Do you know Ethan Chase? It’s like this, he was in a car accident here on xx road, do you have time..."Ethan never imagined the first to arrive after his death would be his beloved Scott Garrison.The youth with gentle eyes hurriedly exited the car and came to the scene. Seeing the body on the ground, he briefly closed his eyes, his demeanor sorrowful.“Are you Mr. Scott Garrison?”“Yes, I’m Scott Garrison. —Ethan’s friend.”Seeing Scott come, Ethan felt so moved he wanted to cry. In these times, when the Chase family was already in ruins, remembering and being kind to him, only Scott remained.He watched Scott talk to the police, seeing the evident sorrow and daze on Scott's face, instinctively wanting to throw himself into Scott’s arms for an embrace.But Ethan fell through - he was a spirit now, naturally unable to touch Scott, and passed right through him.Ethan stared at his hand, then at Scott, unsure whether he felt more sadness or a poignant sense of gratitude.Scott, the man he loved so dearly, had always been tender and gentle toward him.After the paramedics arrived and confirmed Ethan's death, issuing a death certificate since no family showed up, his body was temporarily placed at the nearby hospital.The police, seeing Scott’s effort to hide his grief, empathetically patted his shoulder: "Condolences."Scott’s eyes reddened, barely managing a smile in response to the officer’s comfort: “Thank you.”After dealing with everything, the police took the young man and his vehicle, while Scott also got into his car, ready to leave.Ethan, feeling lost, unable to return to his own body, didn’t know where to go.So, he followed Scott into his car too. Facing such a huge shock and fright, Ethan just wanted to stay close to Scott.Ethan had left Scott's house just half an hour before the incident, the drive only lasting a few minutes. Soon, Scott arrived back at his house.Ethan followed Scott, watching him lock the car, climb the stairs, open the front door, and return to his bedroom, not caring about his soaked clothes, he sat directly on the bed.Scott was zoning out, his eyes still red - it was easy to see how sorrowful he had looked a moment ago.Ethan felt heartache, thinking Scott was grieving for him, extending his hand attempting to touch Scott’s finger, but Scott moved his hand away in the next second, pulling out his phone and dialing a number.Then, Ethan heard a conversation that left him in utter despair.“Hello, Vivian?” Scott spoke softly, his tone gentle: “It’s me, Scott.”“Come over to my place, Ethan’s dead.”“...Yes, he's finally dead. I’ve been waiting for this day for so long, finally got rid of this nuisance!”“Haha... Haha! I couldn’t stand that disgusting fellow; he even told me he loved me? Gross. Luckily, we've taken what we needed from the Chase’s assets; he was essentially useless.”…What?Ethan was confused. He looked at Scott, who had just wept over his corpse, now seemingly deranged, the corners of his mouth twisted in a vile and malicious smile.Scott hung up the phone, standing up to pace around the room.He stopped before his bookshelf where an album stood out, showcasing a photo of the two of them together.In the photo, Ethan appeared even more youthful than now - pale and slender, with delicate features, but no less handsome, smiling brightly at the camera.His hand was firmly held by Scott’s, the space between them filled with a subtle warmth and intimacy. Scott looked the same as always - his habitual gentle demeanor was inviting and comforting.Opening the bookshelf, Scott took out the photo frame, his fingers sliding over Ethan’s smiling face, then casually curled into a smirk.“...Thinking about it now, I still feel disgusted, heh.”Hearing Scott speak so, Ethan couldn’t help but feel a stabbing pain in his heart, an uncontrollable desire to cry taking over.He couldn't understand why things had turned out this way.Hearing a knock at the door, Scott snapped back to reality: "Coming."He pulled the picture from the frame and threw it into the trash without hesitation, then went to open the door.
