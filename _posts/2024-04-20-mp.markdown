Synopsis:
[Cold Aloof CEO x Innocently Naive Young Master]
After a fatal car accident, Alex Chu, became a spirit. Observing the world from a third-person view, he discerned who was truly kind and who was masquerading.
Ethan Jian, the taciturn CEO whom Alex once disdained and even feared to approach, turned out to be the only one to pay respects after his death.
The seemingly tender and kind Sean Gou was in fact a scumbag, only drawing close to swindle money and flee, now having led Alex to a total family demise!
Watching Ethan Jian avenge him and shed tears for him, Alex could do nothing but weep.
"Ethan, I'm sorry, so sorry... If there is another life, I will definitely—!"
Reborn one day, Alex Chu decides to live anew and reform himself!
Ethan Jian? Hasten to fall in love and cherish without regrets!
"Alex, how are you feeling now? Still hurting?"
"Woo... It hurts!" Alex Chu gazes greedily at the man before him, his heart filled with the gratitude of one who has survived a disaster.
"Where does it hurt? Let's go to the hospital now."
"Ethan, actually, we don’t need to go to the hospital." Alex hooks his hand around Ethan Jian's neck: "Just hold me, and I’ll feel no pain."
Scumbag Sean Gou? Dig a pit for him to fall into! Deceive him till he has not a penny to his name!
"Sean Gou, it's merely everyone’s betrayal, wife and children leaving, company bankruptcy, and you can't even handle that?"

Chapter 1: Completely Gone  
The rain was pouring down.  
Chase Carter walked down the road under his umbrella, his feet sinking alternately into deep and shallow puddles.  
Even after getting the life-saving money from his father, he was still somewhat out of sorts.  
A sudden loud honk from behind made Chase jump. He instinctively turned around to see the blinding headlights and a car speeding towards him.  
The roaring of the engine and the splash of the wheels on the wet pavement became deafeningly clear at that moment. Chase's eyes narrowed; he couldn't even let out a sound before losing consciousness.  
When he came to, he saw himself lying on the ground.  
Was he... dead?  
Chase looked down and extended his hand in front of him. It was transparent, glowing faintly in the night. He felt his body light and somewhat cold.  
Besides the car that hit him, it seemed that a black Maybach also got caught up in the accident.  
From the car that struck him, a young man in his twenties, of unremarkable appearance, emerged. The youth looked worn out and clearly couldn't see Chase standing there. He walked over to Chase's body, bent down for a careful look, and then nodded.  
"He's gone, completely gone."  
Then, the young man took out his cell phone and made a call. Chase walked over and heard him clearly.  
"...yes, he's dead, no breathing. ...the money promised to my sister, make sure it gets to her. ...don't worry, I'll confess that it was me."  
After hanging up the call, the youth sighed with relief and dialed another number, "Hello, is this 911? I've hit someone, on XX road. Yes, I did it."  
Chase was certain he didn't know this young man and felt baffled by the situation. Soon, the police arrived and quickly cordoned off the scene to start their inquiry.  
The place became noisy with activity. The police found his phone with a shattered screen on his body: "The deceased is Chase Carter, male, twenty-three years old..."  
Normally, they would call for the next of kin, wouldn't they?  
Chase watched as the police sifted through his contacts and dialed his father's number, and he couldn't help but let out a wry smile.  
His father was seriously ill in bed, let alone coming over; picking up the phone was a struggle.  
Without reaching anyone by phone, the two officers looked at each other, helplessness in their gaze, then they dialed another number: "Hello, is this Mr. Garrison? Do you know Chase Carter? It's like this, he was in a car accident on XX road, and we were wondering if you could..."  
Never in his wildest dreams did Chase think that the first person to rush to the scene would be the man he loved, Scott Garrison.  
Scott had a gentle look in his eyes, hurried out of his car, and approached the scene. Upon recognizing the body on the ground, he closed his eyes slightly, his expression one of deep sorrow.  
"5月I ask if you are Scott Garrison, Mr. Garrison?"  
"Yes, I'm Scott Garrison. --Chase's friend."  
Seeing Scott arrive, Chase felt a lump in his throat and nearly burst into tears. In these trying times when the Carter family was falling apart, the only one who remembered him and treated him well was Scott.  
Watching Scott interact with the police, seeing the evident grief and daze on his face, Chase instinctively wanted to rush over for an embrace.  
But Chase plunged through the air; he was now a spirit and, naturally, could not touch Scott's physical body, passing directly through him instead.  
Chase gazed at his hands in bewilderment, then back at Scott. He couldn't tell if he felt more sadness or a bittersweet mix of heartache and gratitude.  
Scott, the man he had loved for so many years, had always been tender towards him.  
Paramedics arrived soon after and confirmed Chase's death, issuing a death certificate. With no family members present, the body was temporarily stored at a nearby hospital.  
The empathy in the officer's pat on Scott's shoulder was evident, offering a simple consolation: "Stay strong."  
Tears brimming in his eyes, Scott managed a faint smile in response to the officer's comfort: "Thank you."  
After everything was settled, the police took away the young man and his car, and Scott got into his own car, prepared to go home.  
Chase was confused; he could no longer return to his body and didn't know where to go.  
So, he followed Scott into the car, reeling from the shock. Having just left Scott's house half 1 小时之前 before the accident, the drive was but a few minutes, and soon, Scott was back home.  
Chase followed Scott upstairs, watched him lock the car, enter the building, open the door to his home, and return to the bedroom. Without caring for his drenched clothes, Scott sat down on the bed directly.  
Lost in thought, Scott's eyes were still red, barely recovering from his recent distress.  
Chase felt for Scott's sadness on his behalf, reached out to touch Scott's hand, but in the next second, Scott moved his hand away and took out his phone, dialing a number.  
Then Chase heard the conversation that shattered him.  
"Hello, Vivian?" Scott's voice was gentle, tender as always: "It's me, Scott."  
"Come over to my place, Chase is dead."  
"...yeah, he's finally gone, finally dead. I've been waiting for this day for so long, got rid of that nuisance!"  
"Haha... Haha! I couldn't stand that disgusting guy, he had the nerve to talk about love? Disgusting. Luckily we've already taken what we could from the Carter estate; he was useless anyway."  
...what?  
Chase was at a loss; he looked at the man who had shed tears over his body moments ago, now seemingly deranged, grinning with a twisted, venomous curl of his lips.  
Scott ended the call and stood up to pace the room.  
He stopped in front of a bookcase. Prominently displayed there was a picture frame that held a photo of them together.  
The Chase in the picture looked even younger than now, fair-skinned and slender, with refined features and a radiant smile towards the camera.  
His hand was firmly clasped by Scott, suggesting a gentle warmth and closeness between them. Scott's expression had not changed, his usual gentleness making him approachable.  
Scott opened the bookcase, took out the frame, and ran his fingers over the photo, over Chase's smiling face, and then smirked carelessly.  
"...thinking back now, that nauseating feeling is still vivid, heh."  
It pained Chase to hear these words, the urge to cry was nearly uncontrollable.  
He really couldn't understand, why had things turned out this way?  
At the sound of a knock on the door, Scott snapped back to reality: "Coming."  
He pulled out the photograph from the frame and tossed it into the trash without hesitation, then went to answer the door.
