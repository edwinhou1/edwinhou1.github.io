>[Ice-cold CEO x Naive Heir]
After perishing in a car accident, Ethan Chase transformed into a spirit. Seeing the world from a third-person perspective, he started to discern who was genuinely sincere and who was merely feigning.
Previously, Ethan loathed and even feared to be near the CEO, Nathan Jennings. Yet, after his death, Nathan was the sole individual to pay his respects.
And Scott Garrison, who pretended to be tender and kind, turned out to be a scoundrel who approached him solely to loot and run, leaving Ethan's family destitute and ruined!
As Ethan watched Nathan avenge him and shed tears for him, apart from crying, there was nothing else he could do.
"Nathan, I apologize, I'm so sorry... If there's another life, I swear I will—!"
Reborn, Ethan decides to cherish life and reform himself!
Nathan Jennings? Fall in love swiftly without wasting the second chance!
"Ethan, how are you now? Still in pain?"
"Ouch...it's painful!" Ethan greedily absorbed the sight of the man before him, overwhelmed with relief as one spared from disaster.
"Where does it hurt? Come on, let's head to the hospital now."
"Nathan, actually, there's no need for a hospital." Ethan's hand curled around Nathan Jennings's neck: "Just embrace me, and I'll cease to feel any pain."
The scoundrel Scott Garrison? Set traps for him! Deceive him to his last penny!
"Scott Garrison, so it's just everyone deserting you, your spouse and children gone, and your business bankrupt—is that too much for you to bear?"

Chapter 1: Dead, Utterly Dead
In the downpouring rain, Ethan Chase trudged along under his umbrella, with each step sinking slightly into the saturated road.
Even after securing the emergency funds from his father, there was still a sense of disorientation and loss haunting him.
Suddenly, a blaring horn from behind startled him, and turning instinctively, he was met with the blinding glare of headlights, and a vehicle charging straight toward him.
The roaring of the engine and the sound of wheels splashing through puddles on the ground became strikingly clear. Ethan's pupils constricted; he had no time to even utter a sound before consciousness slipped away.
When he woke up again, he saw his own body lying on the ground.
Was he... dead?
Ethan looked down; his hand reached out before him, now transparent and faintly glowing in the darkness. His body felt ethereal, almost weightless, and cold.
Looking around, aside from the car that hit him, it seemed that a black Maybach was also involved in the accident.
Ethan saw a non-descript man in his twenties step out from the car that hit him. The man looked haggard and, obviously unable to see Ethan standing there, walked over to his body, bent down for a closer look, and then nodded to himself.
"Dead, utterly dead," he muttered.
Then, the young man took out his phone and made a call. Ethan neared the young man, overhearing him clearly.
"...Yes, he's dead, not breathing anymore. ...Make sure my sister gets the money you promised her. ...Don't worry; I'll admit it was my doing."
After hanging up, the young man sighed as if unburdened, then dialed another number: "Hello, 110? I've hit someone on XX Street. Yes, it was me who hit him."
Ethan was certain he didn't know this young man, and he felt an inexplicable confusion. Soon after, the police arrived at the scene, cordoning off the area, and questioning followed.
The scene was chaotic; the police found Ethan's shattered smartphone on his person: "The deceased is Ethan Chase, male, twenty-three years old..."
Logically, following a death, family members should be informed, right?
Ethan watched as the police scrolled through his contacts and found his father’s number. He sighed in resignation.
His father was bedridden, gravely ill, incapable of hurrying over, or even managing a phone call.
The call didn't go through. The officers exchanged a look of helplessness, then dialed another number: "Hello, is this Mr. Garrison? Do you know Ethan Chase? He’s been in an accident on XX Street, and we were wondering if you could come..."
Ethan could never have imagined that the first person to rush to his side after his death would be the man he loved the most—Scott Garrison.
The young man, with soft features, hurried out of his car and upon acknowledging the body on the ground, closed his eyes briefly, an expression of sorrow crossing his face.
"Are you Scott Garrison, Mr. Garrison?"
"Yes, I'm Scott Garrison. — Ethan's friend."
Watching Scott Garrison's arrival touched Ethan to his core. At a time when his own household was collapsing, the only person who remembered and cared for him was Scott.
Observing Scott interacting with the police, his obviously distraught and distracted appearance, Ethan instinctively lunged toward him, yearning for an embrace.
But Ethan passed right through Scott—being a spirit, he couldn't touch anything, and his attempt was in vain.
Ethan stared dumbfounded at his own hand, then back at Scott, unsure whether he felt more grief or a bittersweet sense of affection.
Scott, the man he'd loved for so many years, had always treated him with unchanging tenderness.
Medical personnel arrived soon after and confirmed Ethan's death, issuing a death certificate. Since no family appeared, his body was temporarily placed in a nearby hospital.
The empathetic police tapped Scott on the shoulder, "Condolences."
Scott's eyes were red, and at the police's words of comfort, he managed a weak semblance of a smile: "Thank you."
After everything was processed, the police took away the young man and his car, and Scott also got into his own vehicle to leave.
Ethan was bewildered; unable to return to his body, he didn't know where to go next.
So he followed and got into Scott's car as well, after such a traumatic experience, wanting nothing more than to be by Scott's side.
Ethan had left Scott's place just half an hour before, a journey of only a few minutes by car, and quickly, Scott was back home.
Ethan trailed behind Scott, watching him lock the car, ascend the stairs, unlock the front door, and return to his bedroom, taking no heed of his drenched clothes as he sat down on the bed.
Scott seemed to daze out, his eyes were still red, one could barely make out the sorrow that had etched itself on his features moments earlier.
Ethan thought Scott's grief was for him, felt heartache, and stretched out a hand to try and touch Scott’s fingers. But Scott moved his hand away the next second, pulled out his phone, and dialed a number.
Then Ethan heard the conversation that devastated him.
"Hello, Vivian?" Scott spoke softly, the tone gentle: "It's me, Scott."
"Come over to my place. Ethan is dead."
"...Yeah, he's finally dead. I've been looking forward to this day for so long, finally rid of this nuisance!"
"Ha ha... Ha! I couldn't stand this revolting guy a second longer, and he even declared his love for me? Utterly disgusting. Thankfully, we've already taken everything we could from Ethan's estate; he truly had no further use."
...What?
Ethan couldn't comprehend the situation. He looked at the man who had just wept over his body, now smiling wickedly, his mouth twisted into a sinister curve.
Scott hung up, then paced around the room.
Pausing at his bookshelf, the most prominent item was a picture frame with a photo of the two of them together.
In the photo, Ethan appeared even more youthful than now, lean and pale, with delicate features, a radiant smile for the camera.
His hand was held tightly by Scott, the space between them filled with modest warmth and intimacy. Scott's demeanor hadn't changed much from then; always the same gentle expression that seemed inviting.
Scott opened the bookshelf, took out the picture frame, his fingers caressed the photo, brushed over Ethan's smiling face, then nonchalantly crooked into a smirk.
"...thinking about it now, that feeling of disgust is still so vivid, heh."
Hearing such words from Scott’s mouth still made Ethan's heart ache uncontrollably, making him want to cry.
He couldn't understand why things ended up like this.
When a knock on the door sounded, Scott snapped back to reality: "Coming."
He removed the photograph from the frame, unhesitant, tossed it into the trash can, and then went to answer the door.
