Ethan Jian, the taciturn CEO whom Alex once disdained and even feared to approach, turned out to be the only one to pay respects after his death.
The seemingly tender and kind Sean Gou was in fact a scumbag, only drawing close to swindle money and flee, now having led Alex to a total family demise!

"Where does it hurt? Let's go to the hospital now."
"Ethan, actually, we don’t need to go to the hospital." Alex hooks his hand around Ethan Jian's neck: "Just hold me, and I’ll feel no pain."
Scumbag Sean Gou? Dig a pit for him to fall into! Deceive him till he has not a penny to his name!
"Sean Gou, it's merely everyone’s betrayal, wife and children leaving, company bankruptcy, and you can't even handle that?"

Chapter 1: Completely Gone  
The rain was pouring down.  
Chase Carter walked down the road under his umbrella, his feet sinking alternately into deep and shallow puddles.  
Even after getting the life-saving money from his father, he was still somewhat out of sorts.  
A sudden loud honk from behind made Chase jump. He instinctively turned around to see the blinding headlights and a car speeding towards him.  
The roaring of the engine and the splash of the wheels on the wet pavement became deafeningly clear at that moment. Chase's eyes narrowed; he couldn't even let out a sound before losing consciousness.  
When he came to, he saw himself lying on the ground.  
Was he... dead?  
Chase looked down and extended his hand in front of him. It was transparent, glowing faintly in the night. He felt his body light and somewhat cold.  
Besides the car that hit him, it seemed that a black Maybach also got caught up in the accident.  
From the car that struck him, a young man in his twenties, of unremarkable appearance, emerged. The youth looked worn out and clearly couldn't see Chase standing there. He walked over to Chase's body, bent down for a careful look, and then nodded.  
"He's gone, completely gone."  
Then, the young man took out his cell phone and made a call. Chase walked over and heard him clearly.  
"...yes, he's dead, no breathing. ...the money promised to my sister, make sure it gets to her. ...don't worry, I'll confess that it was me."  
After hanging up the call, the youth sighed with relief and dialed another number, "Hello, is this 911? I've hit someone, on XX road. Yes, I did it."  
Chase was certain he didn't know this young man and felt baffled by the situation. Soon, the police arrived and quickly cordoned off the scene to start their inquiry.  
The place became noisy with activity. The police found his phone with a shattered screen on his body: "The deceased is Chase Carter, male, twenty-three years old..."  
Normally, they would call for the next of kin, wouldn't they?  
Chase watched as the police sifted through his contacts and dialed his father's number, and he couldn't help but let out a wry smile.  
His father was seriously ill in bed, let alone coming over; picking up the phone was a struggle.  
Without reaching anyone by phone, the two officers looked at each other, helplessness in their gaze, then they dialed another number: "Hello, is this Mr. Garrison? Do you know Chase Carter? It's like this, he was in a car accident on XX road, and we were wondering if you could..."  
Never in his wildest dreams did Chase think that the first person to rush to the scene would be the man he loved, Scott Garrison.  
Scott had a gentle look in his eyes, hurried out of his car, and approached the scene. Upon recognizing the body on the ground, he closed his eyes slightly, his expression one of deep sorrow.  
"May I ask if you are Scott Garrison, Mr. Garrison?"  
"Yes, I'm Scott Garrison. --Chase's friend."  
Seeing Scott arrive, Chase felt a lump in his throat and nearly burst into tears. In these trying times when the Carter family was falling apart, the only one who remembered him and treated him well was Scott.  
Watching Scott interact with the police, seeing the evident grief and daze on his face, Chase instinctively wanted to rush over for an embrace.  
But Chase plunged through the air; he was now a spirit and, naturally, could not touch Scott's physical body, passing directly through him instead.  
Chase gazed at his hands in bewilderment, then back at Scott. He couldn't tell if he felt more sadness or a bittersweet mix of heartache and gratitude.  
Scott, the man he had loved for so many years, had always been tender towards him.  
Paramedics arrived soon after and confirmed Chase's death, issuing a death certificate. With no family members present, the body was temporarily stored at a nearby hospital.  
The empathy in the officer's pat on Scott's shoulder was evident, offering a simple consolation: "Stay strong."  
Tears brimming in his eyes, Scott managed a faint smile in response to the officer's comfort: "Thank you."  
After everything was settled, the police took away the young man and his car, and Scott got into his own car, prepared to go home.  
Chase was confused; he could no longer return to his body and didn't know where to go.  
So, he followed Scott into the car, reeling from the shock. Having just left Scott's house half an hour before the accident, the drive was but a few minutes, and soon, Scott was back home.  
Chase followed Scott upstairs, watched him lock the car, enter the building, open the door to his home, and return to the bedroom. Without caring for his drenched clothes, Scott sat down on the bed directly.  
Lost in thought, Scott's eyes were still red, barely recovering from his recent distress.  
Chase felt for Scott's sadness on his behalf, reached out to touch Scott's hand, but in the next second, Scott moved his hand away and took out his phone, dialing a number.  
Then Chase heard the conversation that shattered him.  
"Hello, Vivian?" Scott's voice was gentle, tender as always: "It's me, Scott."  
"Come over to my place, Chase is dead."  
"...yeah, he's finally gone, finally dead. I've been waiting for this day for so long, got rid of that nuisance!"  
"Haha... Haha! I couldn't stand that disgusting guy, he had the nerve to talk about love? Disgusting. Luckily we've already taken what we could from the Carter estate; he was useless anyway."  
...what?  
Chase was at a loss; he looked at the man who had shed tears over his body moments ago, now seemingly deranged, grinning with a twisted, venomous curl of his lips.  
Scott ended the call and stood up to pace the room.  
He stopped in front of a bookcase. Prominently displayed there was a picture frame that held a photo of them together.  
The Chase in the picture looked even younger than now, fair-skinned and slender, with refined features and a radiant smile towards the camera.  
His hand was firmly clasped by Scott, suggesting a gentle warmth and closeness between them. Scott's expression had not changed, his usual gentleness making him approachable.  
Scott opened the bookcase, took out the frame, and ran his fingers over the photo, over Chase's smiling face, and then smirked carelessly.  
"...thinking back now, that nauseating feeling is still vivid, heh."  
It pained Chase to hear these words, the urge to cry was nearly uncontrollable.  
He really couldn't understand, why had things turned out this way?  
At the sound of a knock on the door, Scott snapped back to reality: "Coming."  
He pulled out the photograph from the frame and tossed it into the trash without hesitation, then went to answer the door.

Chapter 2: He Only Made Me Feel Sick  
Chase Carter still remembered the way Scott Garrison confessed his feelings to him.  
Ever since he became an adult and met Scott, Scott had been relentlessly pursuing him. They dined together every day, went to various places for fun, and Scott would then drive him back home at night.  
One deep night, as Scott was dropping Chase off at his place, he parked the car in front of the vast gates of the Chase estate.  
Chase looked into Scott's eyes, and under the dim light, Scott's eyes were brimming with emotion: "Chase, I like you. Will you go out with me?"  
Chase was blinded by Scott's fervent pursuit and didn't stop to wonder why Scott approached him or why he confessed his affections so soon.  
All he knew was that Scott was dashing and consistently tender towards him.  
So Chase nodded: "Okay."  
Now, however, Scott actually made it known that thinking of him was nauseating.  
At that moment, a female voice interrupted Chase’s reverie: "Scott!"  
Chase snapped back to reality, just as he was about to peek at the doorway, he then witnessed a scene he would never forget.  
Scott, who had professed his love for Chase, was leading a woman into his room, and the two sat down on the living room sofa, exchanged a smile, and then embraced in a kiss.  
The action was prolonged, and their reluctant parting seemed difficult.  
The sound of fabric rubbing and their breathing in the night was particularly grating; Chase covered his ears but found he could still hear everything clearly.  
The woman was Vivienne Wan, the second daughter of the Wan family.  
Chase had seen her a few times before at banquets, and Vivienne was rumored to be quite rebellious, difficult, and ill-tempered.  
At that time, Vivienne had ignored both of them, and Chase thought Scott didn't know her either.  
But now it seemed that their relationship was quite special, and Vivienne wasn’t as bad-tempered as rumors suggested.  
"How did he die?"  
"He came over to borrow money for his father's treatment at night, and after he left, I found a ‘scapegoat’ and hit him on XX Road. He died on the spot."  
"Oh... good, the Chase family is a wreck now. With his death, it's a relief, right?"  
Scott laughed indifferently, obviously not interested in bringing up the topic of Chase: "Let’s not talk about that disgusting guy anymore. I've managed to drain the Chase company over the past two years, plus what the kid handed over to me, totaling tens of millions."  
At the mention of money, Vivienne's eyes lit up. Although she was the second daughter of the Wan family, her rebellious nature and poor temperament meant she was not favored at home.  
Moreover, as she didn't work and idled her days away, despite her appearance as Miss Wan, she had very little money to her name.  
"That much money? Then, Scott, you must buy me those new bags from Maison de Parfum that I've been eyeing for a long time~"  
Vivienne casually sat on Scott's lap, her arms around his neck as she cooed in his ear: "You'll buy them for me, right? Hmm?"  
Scott could hardly resist such seduction from a woman, his breathing grew heavier, and his hand found its way to her waist.  
"Of course, you can have anything you want."  
...
"Vivienne, I love you."  
Scott turned off the lights and gave himself over to indulgence. Whenever they mentioned Chase, they scoffed and spoke derisively.  
“That Chase was such a fool; a little maneuvering on my part and he totally fell for me, not even Julian Jian could save him. He probably thought Julian was the bad guy until he died, haha.”  
“It's your charisma, Scott, and your acting ability~ Otherwise, how could you have fooled that foolish boy, led to his ruin, and still had him see you as a savior?"  
Unbeknownst to the two, there was an invisible presence in the room – a drifting spirit.  
Chase couldn't stand to watch what was happening in front of him, he could only look on helplessly and could not intervene. So he crouched on the ground, covering his ears tightly, closing his eyes firmly, and trying not to pay attention to it all.  
Perhaps it was the intense emotion, or that his form was naturally precarious, for Chase became even more translucent, barely visible.  
How could this be, why did it happen?  
Was Scott the one who brought ruin upon his family, betrayed their relationship, and even the car accident was orchestrated by him?  
Chase was stung by the deceit; he couldn't decide whether he felt more anger or grief as Scott's words pierced his heart like arrows.  
Not knowing whether to cry or resent, Chase could do nothing but futilely cover his ears and close his eyes.  
Unsatiated, the two on the sofa moved to the bedroom, and Chase didn't want to stay there any longer, so he floated through the wall, leaving a place he once cherished but now just wanted to escape.  
But leaving there, where could he go?  
It was still raining outside, and Chase wandered the streets, lost and directionless.  
He could vaguely sense his body, likely sent to a nearby hospital.  
Thankfully, it wasn't the hospital where his father lay ill, Chase thought. If his father knew now of his fatal accident, who knows if he could bear it.  
Wandering aimlessly on the street wasn't great either, so in the end, Chase decided to find his body – or perhaps it should be called a corpse now.  
After death, the soul should return to its place, right? Otherwise how could he reincarnate in the next life.  
With this in mind, Chase went to the hospital. The basement level was rather cold as he passed through a tightly closed door and came beside himself.  
The desolation was too much.  
Now that the Chase family had fallen, those so-called friends had long kept their distance, and Scott's true colors were known.  
Chase believed he still had a few friends, but at times like this, he could only lie here alone in this lifeless place, without a single visitor.  
... He even doubted there would be a funeral, Chase thought.  
Just then, Chase heard footsteps in the hallway, getting closer, messy and rapid – clearly, there was more than one person, and they were in a hurry.  
An anxious voice rose: "Mr. Jian, it's this room. You don't have to be so hurried, please don't get agitated, you—"
The door swung open before the person could finish speaking.  
Chase instinctively looked towards the entrance and then saw someone he never expected.  
A man dressed in black, his tall frame exuded an undeniable presence, only those eyes that were always cold and calculating now held a complex emotion.  
... It was Julian Jian.
--------------------

Chapter 3: Julian Jian's Sincere Emotions  
Chase Carter never thought that the first person to come after his death would be Julian Jian.  
Julian was a few years older than Chase. Because their families were old acquaintances, they were quite familiar with each other.  
Julian was competent at managing the company. At a young age, he had become independent from the Jian family, established his own company, and his business was booming. This success not only elevated Julian but also raised the entire Jian family.  
Though Julian seemed impressive, Chase's impression of him wasn't quite so positive.  
Yes, Julian was handsome. Even with his often cold demeanor, he was undeniably good-looking.  
The first time Chase met Julian, he was quite taken aback by his appearance. So, he admitted that Julian was a handsome guy.  
Chase also admitted that had Julian's disposition appealed to him, he might have been rather clingy.  
But Julian tended to meddle a lot in Chase's life. Since the two families were close, Julian and Chase often met, and as an outstanding contemporary, Julian was prone to make comparisons.  
Chase was a rather carefree and spontaneous person, a bit more naive than most, who only wanted to enjoy life to the fullest without worrying about work or social obligations.  
Given that his parents had always pampered him, as the sole heir of the Carter family, living happily was all that mattered. The cutthroat world of business was unrelated to Chase.  
Hence, Chase detested being constrained, and Julian Jian was the person who liked to constrain him most.  
As the "child next door," when Chase was applying for college, Julian provided him with many suggestions.  
Taking Julian's advice, Chase applied to that college, only to later find out that the professor of his major knew Julian.  
Julian asked the professor to be strict with Chase, leading to Chase always being singled out in class and his assignments scrutinized rigorously.  
For a long time, the usually cheerful young master lived with a distressed and haggard expression.  
"Why did you tell Professor Li to be stricter with me!" Chase vented his frustrations towards Julian: "I've been living in fear of failing my exams, and I'm busy all the time!"  
"It's for your own good. Don't you feel your life is more fulfilled?"  
"Fulfilled? Sure, so fulfilled I don't even have time to drink with friends!"  
Later, when Chase encountered Scott Garrison and they were at their most intimate, Julian threw cold water on him.  
"I advise you not to get too close to Scott."  
"Why?" Chase was incredulous: "We get along very well."  
"His intentions are not pure."  
Chase immediately retorted: "What do you mean, not pure? He's been very nice to me. I think you're just being paranoid."  
In the end, when Chase and Scott became a couple, all his friends sent their blessings, except for Julian, who opposed the relationship.  
"I advise you to reconsider this relationship."  
This time, Chase ran out of patience: "What’s it to you, Julian? We're not that close, so why are you meddling in my life? Who I date is my business, not yours!"  
Julian fell silent, his gaze towards Chase dark and inscrutable. In his eyes, Chase was like a stubborn animal, charging headlong in the wrong direction.  
Eventually, Julian simply closed his eyes and said, "I'm sorry."  
Back then, Chase felt victorious, thinking he had finally escaped Julian's constraints. Looking back now, he realized what a huge joke that was.  
In reality, every piece of advice Julian gave him was spot-on.  
In college, thanks to the professor Julian recommended, though Chase struggled, he excelled in economics and management.  
When the Carter family started to decline and his father fell ill, it was Julian's advice that allowed Chase to barely support the company and his family.  
Julian had been right about Scott's intentions. Now that Chase saw the truth, he realized Julian's genuine concern.  
And now, the person who came to see him was still Julian.  
Chase sighed. Suddenly, he felt that everything he had done in the past twenty years was wrong, and he should have been better to Julian.  
Julian stood at the door, looking at the person covered with a white sheet on the bed. At first, he couldn't believe it, then gradually, his shock faded until his eyes turned inscrutable again.  
But he still stood at the doorway, not moving. Perhaps others might not understand his thoughts, but he didn't dare to enter.  
He feared seeing Chase's all too familiar face. Even though he knew the truth, the strong Julian could not bring himself to walk past indifferently.  
A secretary-like figure stood beside Julian, about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, carrying a briefcase and wearing black-rimmed glasses.  
"President..." Secretary Liu hesitated.  
Julian didn't speak. He closed his eyes and then walked towards the bed.  
Noticing Julian coming, Chase quickly made room for him. The two stood side by side, one real and one ethereal, one knowing and the other unable to see.  
"..." Julian stared at the white sheet covering Chase, then reached out and slowly lifted it.  
As soon as Chase's face was revealed, Julian let go of the sheet.  
Being intangible, Chase couldn't lift the sheet covering him. He was curious about his appearance - was it muddied, twisted in pain?  
He leaned in to look at himself.  
Lying on the bed, he looked peaceful, his face not contorted in anguish. If one ignored the mud on his face, he actually looked rather handsome.  
"My eyelashes are really long," even at a time like this, Chase couldn't resist commenting.  
Not too bad, not too dreadful— at least his face was intact.  
Comforting himself with this thought, Chase turned to see Julian's reaction but suddenly heard a soft sound.  
"—Drip."  
What was that noise? Chase wondered.  
Then, noticing the two spreading stains on the pristine sheet, Chase belatedly turned and saw Julian's trembling hand.  
Julian's face remained expressionless if one ignored his reddened eyes.  
Julian furrowed his brow, extended his hand, and gently wiped the mud from Chase's cheek.  
Following that, Chase watched as the tall man, holding his hand, slowly knelt down.  
"Breaking news on XX Road tonight, an accident resulted in one fatality and one injury. Details of the case are currently under investigation..."
