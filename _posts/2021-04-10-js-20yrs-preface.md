Chapter 2: He Only Made Me Feel Sick  
Chase Carter still remembered the way Scott Garrison confessed his feelings to him.  
Ever since he became an adult and met Scott, Scott had been relentlessly pursuing him. They dined together every day, went to various places for fun, and Scott would then drive him back home at night.  
One deep night, as Scott was dropping Chase off at his place, he parked the car in front of the vast gates of the Chase estate.  
Chase looked into Scott's eyes, and under the dim light, Scott's eyes were brimming with emotion: "Chase, I like you. Will you go out with me?"  
Chase was blinded by Scott's fervent pursuit and didn't stop to wonder why Scott approached him or why he confessed his affections so soon.  
All he knew was that Scott was dashing and consistently tender towards him.  
So Chase nodded: "Okay."  
Now, however, Scott actually made it known that thinking of him was nauseating.  
At that moment, a female voice interrupted Chase’s reverie: "Scott!"  
Chase snapped back to reality, just as he was about to peek at the doorway, he then witnessed a scene he would never forget.  
Scott, who had professed his love for Chase, was leading a woman into his room, and the two sat down on the living room sofa, exchanged a smile, and then embraced in a kiss.  
The action was prolonged, and their reluctant parting seemed difficult.  
The sound of fabric rubbing and their breathing in the night was particularly grating; Chase covered his ears but found he could still hear everything clearly.  
The woman was Vivienne Wan, the second daughter of the Wan family.  
Chase had seen her a few times before at banquets, and Vivienne was rumored to be quite rebellious, difficult, and ill-tempered.  
At that time, Vivienne had ignored both of them, and Chase thought Scott didn't know her either.  
But now it seemed that their relationship was quite special, and Vivienne wasn’t as bad-tempered as rumors suggested.  
"How did he die?"  
"He came over to borrow money for his father's treatment at night, and after he left, I found a ‘scapegoat’ and hit him on XX Road. He died on the spot."  
"Oh... good, the Chase family is a wreck now. With his death, it's a relief, right?"  
Scott laughed indifferently, obviously not interested in bringing up the topic of Chase: "Let’s not talk about that disgusting guy anymore. I've managed to drain the Chase company over the past two years, plus what the kid handed over to me, totaling tens of millions."  
At the mention of money, Vivienne's eyes lit up. Although she was the second daughter of the Wan family, her rebellious nature and poor temperament meant she was not favored at home.  
Moreover, as she didn't work and idled her days away, despite her appearance as Miss Wan, she had very little money to her name.  
"That much money? Then, Scott, you must buy me those new bags from Maison de Parfum that I've been eyeing for a long time~"  
Vivienne casually sat on Scott's lap, her arms around his neck as she cooed in his ear: "You'll buy them for me, right? Hmm?"  
Scott could hardly resist such seduction from a woman, his breathing grew heavier, and his hand found its way to her waist.  
"Of course, you can have anything you want."  
...
"Vivienne, I love you."  
Scott turned off the lights and gave himself over to indulgence. Whenever they mentioned Chase, they scoffed and spoke derisively.  
“That Chase was such a fool; a little maneuvering on my part and he totally fell for me, not even Julian Jian could save him. He probably thought Julian was the bad guy until he died, haha.”  
“It's your charisma, Scott, and your acting ability~ Otherwise, how could you have fooled that foolish boy, led to his ruin, and still had him see you as a savior?"  
Unbeknownst to the two, there was an invisible presence in the room – a drifting spirit.  
Chase couldn't stand to watch what was happening in front of him, he could only look on helplessly and could not intervene. So he crouched on the ground, covering his ears tightly, closing his eyes firmly, and trying not to pay attention to it all.  
Perhaps it was the intense emotion, or that his form was naturally precarious, for Chase became even more translucent, barely visible.  
How could this be, why did it happen?  
Was Scott the one who brought ruin upon his family, betrayed their relationship, and even the car accident was orchestrated by him?  
Chase was stung by the deceit; he couldn't decide whether he felt more anger or grief as Scott's words pierced his heart like arrows.  
Not knowing whether to cry or resent, Chase could do nothing but futilely cover his ears and close his eyes.  
Unsatiated, the two on the sofa moved to the bedroom, and Chase didn't want to stay there any longer, so he floated through the wall, leaving a place he once cherished but now just wanted to escape.  
But leaving there, where could he go?  
It was still raining outside, and Chase wandered the streets, lost and directionless.  
He could vaguely sense his body, likely sent to a nearby hospital.  
Thankfully, it wasn't the hospital where his father lay ill, Chase thought. If his father knew now of his fatal accident, who knows if he could bear it.  
Wandering aimlessly on the street wasn't great either, so in the end, Chase decided to find his body – or perhaps it should be called a corpse now.  
After death, the soul should return to its place, right? Otherwise how could he reincarnate in the next life.  
With this in mind, Chase went to the hospital. The basement level was rather cold as he passed through a tightly closed door and came beside himself.  
The desolation was too much.  
Now that the Chase family had fallen, those so-called friends had long kept their distance, and Scott's true colors were known.  
Chase believed he still had a few friends, but at times like this, he could only lie here alone in this lifeless place, without a single visitor.  
... He even doubted there would be a funeral, Chase thought.  
Just then, Chase heard footsteps in the hallway, getting closer, messy and rapid – clearly, there was more than one person, and they were in a hurry.  
An anxious voice rose: "Mr. Jian, it's this room. You don't have to be so hurried, please don't get agitated, you—"
The door swung open before the person could finish speaking.  
Chase instinctively looked towards the entrance and then saw someone he never expected.  
A man dressed in black, his tall frame exuded an undeniable presence, only those eyes that were always cold and calculating now held a complex emotion.  
... It was Julian Jian.
